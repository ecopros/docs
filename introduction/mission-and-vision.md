# Mission & Vision

### Mission

Financing clean energy projects using Web3 capital. While there has been a lot of progress towards a sustainable future and clean energy systems are becoming cheaper to build and install, there still are a lot of opportunities to accelerate the transition to clean energy. The Web3 revolution finally allows us to let anyone invest in sustainability projects on-chain and help individuals and companies transition from unsustainable energy sources faster.

###

### Vision

Empower clean energy installers with tools needed to create a decentralised energy system globally. We will do this by creating a decentralised investing platform that allows any Web3 user to invest their capital to build clean energy systems across the globe.
