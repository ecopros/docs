# How to join?

We use Wonder and Discord to collaborate.

Join our DAO here on Wonder: https://app.wonderverse.xyz/invite/YkcXAWYT9znAvg.

Discord: https://discord.gg/T24A8VePHY.



The easiest way to become a contributor is to submit a work bout to [one of our active bounties](https://app.wonderverse.xyz/organization/ecopros/boards?entity=bounty). After your submission is accepted you will receive a Contributor role on Discord and Wonder.



Joining our community by itself is just a first step, and although participating actively isn't mandatory, we encourage you to look at the list of active tasks and bounties, ask questions if you find something needs more clarification and try to see if you can bring something to the table. Here are a few examples of what you can do apart from the active tasks/bounties:

* Chat on Discord - open a discussion, post interesting topics
* Share our community - we need everyone on board to build the decentralised energy grid!
