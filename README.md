# What is ecoPros DAO?

The ecoPros DAO was created to build a community around our core mission, vision, and values. It is powered by the ecoPros Governance token (EPG), a central point of the network. The token exists as a utility for incentive alignment amongst the participants. Apart from the protocol utility, token holders can vote for or against Proposals in the ecoPros DAO.
